## Description
The region of woods surrounding the [[City of Linor]] is vast and largely unexplored. Due to the potential dangers that may lurk within, the city has erected walls for protection. Though many tales are told of fantastical creatures that reside within the woods, actual sightings and confirmations of these myths are rare. However, it's important to note that even though the woods may be home to dangerous creatures, they generally steer clear of human activity.

If one chooses to venture into these woods, it is crucial to exercise caution and remain alert at all times. The unknown dangers that may be present should not be taken lightly and proper precautions should be taken to ensure a safe journey.
