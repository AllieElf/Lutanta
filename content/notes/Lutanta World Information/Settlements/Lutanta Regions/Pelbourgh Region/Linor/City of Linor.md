Linor is a large costal village, the sides of which are touching a large lake (Lake Linor). Many fisheries dot the landscape, providing the city with fish to eat. The outer edge of the city is surrounded by a tall stone wall, with fortifications and archers stationed on top. The streets are muddied and cobbled, with many large townhomes. You can hear the chime of temple bells, the hammering of forges, and the clacking of hooves on the cobbled paths. The air smells of muddied earth, smoking meat, lake air, and faintly of fish.
