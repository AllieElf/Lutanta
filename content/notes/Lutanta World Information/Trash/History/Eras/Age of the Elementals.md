## Description
---
The gods emerged from chaos and darkness and used their magic to create the world of [[Lutanta]] and all its elements. They created elementals to maintain balance and harmony in the natural world. The gods believed that magic in the hands of mortals would upset the natural order and lead to chaos. They saw their role as maintaining balance and harmony in the world, and thus, they sought to prevent mortals from using magic. The gods were self-interested beings and were motivated to protect their own interests. When [[Xanthe]] gave magic to mortals, the other gods saw this as a threat to their own interests and sought to intervene to protect themselves.
