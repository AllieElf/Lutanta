## Description
---
The elementals, created by the gods, played a crucial role in maintaining balance in the world of [[Lutanta]]. They were made of the raw elements of the world and were tasked with ensuring that these elements were in harmony and balance. However, the introduction of magic to mortals by [[Xanthe]] disrupted this balance, leading the gods to send the elementals to eliminate humanity. Ultimately, peace was established between the humans and the gods, with the elementals continuing to play a role in maintaining balance in the world.
