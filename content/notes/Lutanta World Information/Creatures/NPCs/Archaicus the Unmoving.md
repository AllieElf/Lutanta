## General Description
Archaicus is a tall, lanky humanoid skeleton. His bones are yellowed with age, with tattered bits of cloth still clinging to some bones. 

His legs end at his knee, lost in an unspecified event. His bones are chipped in many different parts, and there is a soft green glow in his eye sockets.

> [!question]- GM Information
>  - Was once a member of a secret society called @[](travkhiyrq). This cult was founded in 695, and realized portal technologies in 600. In order to create a rift, they had to construct the frame in a specific location, where @[](aifczrxklm) was constructed.
>  - Whilst the portal opening was successful, they underestimated the amount of magic needed to keep it open, and $[objectname]'s mortal flesh was stripped from his bones. Cursed as an immortal skeleton, he has wandered the earth for 500 years. Finding no satisfaction in his treatment outside of the Hold, he decided to attempt to guard the keep, but due to the accident, he is restricted to a fraction of his power.
>  - Defeated, and having the ancient Hold overrun with goblins, he decided to sleep for as long as he can, hoping to one day find purpose.
